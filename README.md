# SugarscapePensions
This model extends Epstein &amp; Axtell's Sugarscape Wealth Distribution model,  described in chapter 2 of their book Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up. More specifically, Uri Wilensky NetLogo implementation, licensed under a creative common license in 2009, is used as base for this implementation. The model extension allows pension laws and social services effects to be studied. The original simulation provides a ground-up simulation of inequality in wealth. Only a minority of the population have above average wealth, while most agents have wealth near the same level as the initial endowment. The inequity of the resulting distribution can be described graphically by the Lorenz curve and quantitatively by the Gini coefficient. The new graphical descriptions include among others: working and retired agents, savings in a pension piggy bank, working agents and retired agents in socially excluded, and agents who used social services.
